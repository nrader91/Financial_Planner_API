# Financial_Planner_API
This scenario will take an interesting deep dive into prediction analysis.  The scenario is to create a tool that shows members how to enhance their financial health.  The task is develop a prototype application to demo at the next assembly,

There will be a heavy focus on using API tools to both visualize investments and using those current investments to run a prediction model.  The prediction model will double as a retirement planning tool.

The second half of the project will be running Monte Carlo simulations with different data to show customers expected portfolio returns with specific investment amounts.  The goal of this is to advise customers what to expect when planning for retirment.
